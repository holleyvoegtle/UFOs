# UFOs

##  Overview of the project (explain purpose)
A dynamic website was created with the use of HTML and Javascript. Javascript is a coding language that was designed to enhance HTML and is the backbone of many visualization libraries. Javascript also provides a high level of customization to deliver visual data such as maps and graphs. The website that was created also used the skills learned from Bootstrap. The results of this project is to create something that is visual attractive and appealing while being interactive. 

The topic of the website in UFOs. Initially the website was created to have a section of information followed by a search and filter function based on location and UFO sightings. The data comes from a Javascript dataset that contains such things as city location, countries, and shapes of the UFOs. Building from the initial website we build, more filters are added. 

## Results 

The results of the website can be viewed through the use of VS code index as well as referencing app.js and data.js. The final website is clean and interactive. You can search for different cities, dates, states, countries, and shapes. The interesting thing about the search criteria is that it was made so that you do not need to fill out every filter box. If you only want to filter by state or date for example, you can do that. An example of this can be seen in the following image. There are placeholders (such as date) but this example only has city and state.

## Summary 

In summary, the results of this website is nice to look at and easy to play with interactively. One drawback of the website is that you need to be very specific about what cities are listed in the dataset. Two recommendations for further development would be having more information that accompanies the filters such as weather. Another recommendation would be have instead of specific dates, you can search by seasons. Overall this was a fun project to create.
